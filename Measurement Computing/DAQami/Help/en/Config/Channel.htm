<h1>Configuring Channels</h1>
<p>Use the <strong>Channels tab</strong> on the Configuration Panel to activate and configure the analog, digital, and counter I/O channels to include in the acquisition. The settings that display are specific to the device selected on the Device Panel.</p>
<p>Channel settings are stored in a <span class="code">.amicfg</span> file when you save the configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: When running <em>concurrent</em> input and/or output operations with DAQami &ndash; whether among multiple devices or on a single device &ndash; there may be time lags between the data being acquired and/or generated for each operation. Although every effort is made to coordinate data timing between subsystems and devices, because all except one susbsystem is started through software, the <em>virtual</em> nature of the trigger for starting each operation  results in some variation, particularly in the starting time.<br><br>
When running <em>composite</em> I/O operations with DAQami using USB-1808 Series or USB-CTR Series devices, all susbsystem operations are synchronized by sharing a single hardware clock.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When continuously acquiring more than 1 million samples per channel, you may experience performance issues depending on the PC that is running DAQami, the number of channels being sampled, the sample rate, and other factors. For optimal performance in this scenario, reduce the sample rate, reduce the number of active channels, and/or install a faster hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: When selecting channels on this tab, press &lt;Shift&gt; to select multiple contiguous channels at the same time, or &lt;Ctrl&gt; to select and configure multiple non-contiguous channels. To select all channels, click anywhere in the grid and press &lt;Ctrl-A&gt;. The settings selected for one channel are applied to all selected <em>active</em> channels.</p>

<p>The data rate controls the amount of the noise filtering on each channel in a DAQami acquisition. By reducing the data rate, the averaging of samples increases, and noise drops correspondingly.</p>
<p>If low noise is your main concern, select a very low data rates starting from 2.5 Hz. At low rates, much of the noise is averaged out of the data, and issues such as reference noise become less important.</p>

<p>At higher data rates, higher-frequency noise sources are not averaged out and can begin to be problematic. These
noise sources include the noise inherent in the A/D converter itself, which is not reducible.
Since TCs can pick up noise in your environment, select a data rate based on the primary noise frequency.</p>
<p>For example, to reduce the effect of 60 Hz noise, select a data rate of 60 Hz (or a supported multiple of 60, such as 10 Hz or 5 Hz).</p>

<p>When acquiring from multiple channels, the sample rate is the same for all channels, but channels with a lower data rate have more filtering, or averaging, performed on the data.</p>
<p>For example, if you set a 10 Hz data rate for channel 0, and a 50 Hz data rate for channel 1, both
channels pass the same number of samples per second to the host computer. However, more averaging is performed on channel 0 samples; therefore, channel 0 is sampled at a higher resolution.</p>
<p>The A/D converter on USB-2408 Series and USB-2416 Series devices perform averaging, and the number of averages equals 30,000/data rate.
In this example, channel 0 is sampled 3000 times over 100 ms, and all samples are averaged into one sample.
Then, channel 1 is sampled 600 times over 20 ms, and samples are likewise averaged into one sample.
The final samples are available to you at a maximum rate of about 8 Hz (8.245 Hz).</p>
